This paper describes a method for 3D reconstructing underwater scenes, 
specifically the terrain and its coral reefs using stereo vision. The method
 consists of preprocessing the images, extracting the foreground of the image,
 computing the disparity map, filtering the disparity map, constructing the point cloud
  from the disparity map and then meshing the point cloud.
