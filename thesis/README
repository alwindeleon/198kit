On the command line type

> make biblio

the first time you compile thesis.tex and every time you modify
biblio.bib.

When you make changes to any of the *.tex files you will have to
update the *.dvi file:

> make thesis

To view your document, use xdvi

> xdvi thesis

or ghostview

> ghostview thesis.ps


Do the same for the User's Manual and for the Technical Report:

> make users
> xdvi users

> make techrep
> xdvi techrep

To generate pdf the files type for all

> make psandpdf 


IMPORTANT !!!!
Before submitting your latex files to your Adviser type

> make real-clean

This will remove all auxilliary files created by Latex.
